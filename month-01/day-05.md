## Documentation

### Roles in Web Development

- **Frontend Development:** Deals with the part of the website that users interact with directly. It includes designing and implementing web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend Development:** Involves server-side activities such as database management, server logic, and application integration using various backend programming languages.
- **Full Stack Development:** A comprehensive role that encompasses both frontend and backend development, allowing a developer to build and manage an entire web application.

### HTML Basics

- **HTML Introduction:** Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications.
- **HTML Structure:** An HTML document starts with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **HTML File Extensions:** HTML files typically have .html or .htm extensions.
- **Project Structure:**
  - Created a new project with the following structure:
    ```
    project-name
    ├── README.md
    ├── index.html
    ├── about.html
    ├── contact.html
    └── images
        ├── avatar.jpg
        └── image.png
    ```
- **HTML5 Tags:** Learned various HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, `<img>`, `<a>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`-`<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, and more.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Used Visual Studio Code for coding, with the Live Server extension for real-time updates.

### Website Deployment

- **Deployment Introduction:** Deploying a website involves hosting it on a server to make it accessible over the internet.
- **Vercel Deployment:** Deployed the project to Vercel, a popular hosting service provider known for its ease of use and integration with GitHub.

### IP, Domain, URL, HTTP/HTTPS, CDN

- **IP and Domain:**
  - **IP Address:** A unique string of numbers separated by periods that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.
  - **Domain:** A human-readable address that maps to an IP address through the Domain Name System (DNS).
- **URL and HTTP/HTTPS:**
  - **URL:** Uniform Resource Locator, the address of a web resource on the internet.
  - **HTTP:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol, the foundation of any data exchange on the Web.
  - **HTTPS:** HTTP Secure, an extension of HTTP for secure communication over a computer network.
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network):**
  - **CDN:** A network of servers that deliver web content and resources to users based on their geographic location, improving load times and site performance.

## Next Steps

- Continue practicing HTML to become more proficient in structuring web pages.
- Explore CSS to style the web pages created with HTML.
- Experiment with more advanced deployment options and hosting providers.
